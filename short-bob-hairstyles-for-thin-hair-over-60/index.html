Use a round brush and a blow dryer to lift the roots and create volume. Take small sections of hair and wrap them around the brush, directing the heat towards the roots. 3. Once your hair is dry, use a curling iron or hot rollers to add texture and movement to your hair. Take small sections of hair and wrap them around the curling iron or hot roller, holding for a few seconds before releasing. 4. Finish off your hairstyle with a light-hold hairspray to keep it in place. Avoid using too much product, as it can weigh down your hair and make it look flat. <h2>What If Short Bob Hairstyles for Thin Hair Over 60?</h2><p> If you're still unsure about whether a short bob hairstyle is right for you, consider trying out a temporary option first.
