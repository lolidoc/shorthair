Divide your hair into sections and clip them up to keep them out of the way. Start with the bottom layer and gradually work your way up.</p><p>3. Take a small section of hair and comb it straight. Hold the scissors at an angle and make small, precise cuts. Remember to trim a little at a time to avoid removing too much length.</p><p>4. Continue this process for each section of hair, always combing it straight before cutting. Take your time and be patient, as cutting hair requires precision and attention to detail.</p><p>In conclusion, cutting long thick hair at home is a task that can be accomplished with the right tools and techniques.

This will make it easier to see the natural texture and ensure an even cut.</p><p>2. Divide your hair into manageable sections. Use hair clips to secure each section, starting from the bottom and working your way up.</p><p>3. Take a small section of hair and comb it straight.

Continue this process for each section, making sure to blend the cuts as you go. Take your time and regularly check the mirror to see how the hair is falling.</p><p>5. Once you've finished cutting, style your hair as desired. You can use a straightener, curling iron, or leave it natural for a relaxed look.</p><h2>History and Myth of Cutting Long Thick Hair at Home</h2><p>The practice of cutting long thick hair at home dates back centuries.
