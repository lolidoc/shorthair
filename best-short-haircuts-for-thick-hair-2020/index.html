Luckily, there are plenty of short haircuts for thick hair in 2020 that can help alleviate these frustrations and give you a fresh new look.</p><p>Having thick hair can be a blessing and a curse. While it's great to have a full head of hair, it can also be time-consuming and challenging to style. Thick hair tends to be heavy, making it difficult to hold a style for long periods. It can also become frizzy or unmanageable if not properly maintained. These pain points can be frustrating and make it hard to find a haircut that works for you.</p><p>The best short haircuts for thick hair in 2020 are designed to address these pain points and make styling easier. These haircuts typically involve cutting the hair shorter, which reduces weight and helps to manage the thickness. They also often incorporate layers or texture to add movement and create a more flattering shape. With the right short haircut, you can transform your thick hair into a stylish and manageable look.</p><h2>Best Short Haircuts for Thick Hair 2020: A Personal Experience</h2><p>As someone with thick hair, I understand the struggle of finding the perfect haircut.

Each of these haircuts is designed to add movement and reduce weight, making them ideal for thick hair. It's important to consult with a professional hairstylist who can assess your hair type and face shape and recommend the best short haircut for you.</p><h2>The History and Myth of Best Short Haircuts for Thick Hair 2020</h2><p>Short haircuts have been popular for centuries, with different trends and styles emerging throughout history.

This will help keep your hair hydrated and prevent it from becoming dry or brittle.</p><p>3. Embrace air-drying: Short haircuts for thick hair often look best when air-dried. Instead of relying on heat styling tools, try letting your hair dry naturally for a more effortless and tousled look.</p><p>4.
