Whether you want to add some volume, soften your features, or emphasize your jawline, we've got you covered.</p><p>Having a long square face can come with its own set of challenges. You may find it difficult to find a haircut that flatters your face shape and enhances your natural beauty. But fear not, with the right haircut, you can accentuate your best features and create a stunning look.</p><p>So, what is the best short haircut for a long square face? The answer is simple - a pixie cut! Pixie cuts are short and sleek, making them perfect for elongating the face and adding balance. They also highlight the cheekbones and jawline, creating a more defined and feminine look.</p><p>In summary, the best short haircut for a long square face is a pixie cut. This haircut is ideal for elongating the face, adding balance, and highlighting your best features. Now, let's dive deeper into the world of pixie cuts and explore their different styles and variations.</p><h2>Why Choose a Pixie Cut for a Long Square Face?</h2><p>A pixie cut is a short hairstyle that is typically cut close to the head and styled to create a sleek and chic look. It is a versatile haircut that can be customized to suit different face shapes and personal styles. For a long square face, a pixie cut can be particularly flattering because:</p><p>1. It adds length to the face: The short length of a pixie cut helps to create the illusion of a longer face, balancing out the square shape.</p><p>2. It highlights the cheekbones and jawline: A pixie cut draws attention to the cheekbones and jawline, creating a more defined and feminine look.</p><p>3. It is low-maintenance: Pixie cuts are easy to style and require minimal effort to maintain, making them a practical choice for busy individuals.</p><p>4. It accentuates facial features: With a pixie cut, your facial features are on full display, allowing you to showcase your unique beauty.</p><h2>The History and Myth of Pixie Cuts</h2><p>The pixie cut has a long history that dates back to the early 20th century. It gained popularity in the 1920s as women started to embrace shorter hairstyles as a symbol of independence and rebellion against societal norms. The term "pixie cut" originated in the 1950s and refers to the playful and mischievous nature of pixies, mythical creatures known for their short hair and sprightly personalities.</p><p>Despite its association with femininity and beauty, the pixie cut has often been met with controversy and criticism. Some people believe that short hair is not feminine or attractive, while others see it as a bold and empowering choice. Ultimately, the decision to get a pixie cut should be based on personal preference and confidence.</p><h2>The Hidden Secret of Pixie Cuts</h2><p>The hidden secret of pixie cuts is their ability to transform your look and boost your confidence. By embracing a shorter hairstyle, you are stepping out of your comfort zone and embracing change. Pixie cuts can be a powerful symbol of self-expression and individuality. They allow you to break free from societal expectations and embrace your true self.</p><h2>Recommendation for Pixie Cuts</h2><p>If you're considering getting a pixie cut for your long square face, here are a few recommendations to keep in mind:</p><p>1. Consult with a professional hairstylist: A hairstylist can help you determine the best pixie cut for your face shape and provide expert advice on styling and maintenance.</p><p>2. Consider your lifestyle and personal style: Choose a pixie cut that aligns with your lifestyle and personal style. Whether you prefer a bold and edgy look or a more classic and sophisticated style, there is a pixie cut out there for you.</p><p>3. Experiment with different lengths and textures: Pixie cuts come in various lengths and textures, so don't be afraid to try different styles. You may discover a new favorite that complements your long square face perfectly.</p><h3>Tips for Maintaining a Pixie Cut</h3><p>Now that you have a stunning pixie cut, here are some tips to keep it looking its best:</p><p>1. Regular trims: Pixie cuts require regular trims to maintain their shape and prevent split ends. Visit your hairstylist every 4-6 weeks for touch-ups.</p><p>2. Use the right products: Invest in high-quality hair products that are specifically designed for short hairstyles. These products can help you achieve the desired texture and hold without weighing down your hair.</p><p>3. Experiment with styling: Pixie cuts offer endless styling possibilities. Play around with different hair accessories, textures, and techniques to create unique and eye-catching looks.</p><h4>Question and Answer</h4><p>Q: Can I still style my pixie cut if I have a long square face?</p><p>A: Absolutely! Pixie cuts are highly versatile and can be styled in various ways to suit different face shapes. Consult with your hairstylist to find the best styling options for your long square face.</p><p>Q: Will a pixie cut make my face look even longer?</p><p>A: No, a pixie cut is actually great for elongating the face and creating balance. It can help to soften the angles of a square face and create a more feminine look.</p><p>Q: Do I need to have thick hair to pull off a pixie cut?</p><p>A: Pixie cuts can work well for both thick and thin hair. Your hairstylist can adapt the cut and styling techniques to suit your hair type and desired look.</p><p>Q: How can I add volume to my pixie cut?</p><p>A: To add volume to your pixie cut, use a volumizing mousse or spray and blow-dry your hair upside down. You can also experiment with different styling techniques, such as backcombing or using a small round brush.</p><h2>Conclusion of Pixie Cuts</h2><p>In conclusion, a pixie cut is the best short haircut for a long square face. It is a versatile and stylish option that can enhance your features and create a flattering look. With the right cut and styling techniques, you can rock a pixie cut with confidence and embrace your unique beauty.</p></article>
