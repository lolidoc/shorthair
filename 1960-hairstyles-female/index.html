Women faced the pain points of finding a hairstyle that suited their face shape, hair type, and personal style.</p><p>So, what were the popular 1960 hairstyles for females? The 1960s saw the rise of the beehive, a voluminous updo that added height and drama to women's hair. This hairstyle was achieved by teasing the hair at the crown and using excessive amounts of hairspray to create a gravity-defying look. Another popular hairstyle was the bob, which was a sleek and angular cut that framed the face and accentuated the jawline. Women also experimented with shorter pixie cuts, which were inspired by the fashion-forward style of iconic figures like Twiggy.</p><h2>Personal Experience with 1960 Hairstyles Female</h2><p>As a hairstylist, I have had the opportunity to recreate and modernize the iconic 1960 hairstyles for my clients.
