Layered hairstyles are a great way to combat these issues, as they add volume and texture to the hair, creating a more youthful and vibrant look. Additionally, the layers can help to frame the face and draw attention away from any areas that you may not feel as confident about.</p><p>The target of layered hairstyles for over 60 round face and glasses is to create a hairstyle that is both flattering and age-appropriate.
