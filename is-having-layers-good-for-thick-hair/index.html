Layers can add movement, texture, and dimension to your hair, making it easier to style and manage.

In the 1970s, layered hairstyles became particularly popular, with celebrities like Farrah Fawcett and Jane Fonda sporting iconic layered looks.</p><p>Despite the long history and popularity of layered hairstyles, there are some myths and misconceptions surrounding them. One common myth is that layers are only suitable for certain hair types. However, this is not true.
