They may experience issues such as excessive bulk, lack of movement, and difficulty in holding a shape. These pain points can make it frustrating to find a haircut that flatters their natural hair texture.</p><p>The best haircut for thick, straight hair is one that takes into consideration the thickness and density of the hair while adding movement and shape. A layered haircut is ideal for thick, straight hair as it helps to remove bulk and create movement.
