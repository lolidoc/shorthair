Protective Styles\u003c\/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e Protective styles are a great option for individuals with no edges.

These styles not only protect your hair but also provide versatility and creativity in your everyday look. \u003c\/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e2.

These styles can cause further damage and potentially worsen the condition of your edges. Opt for more gentle and low-tension styles that promote hair health and growth. \u003c\/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eQ: How long does it take to regrow edges?\u003c\/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003e A: The regrowth process can vary depending on the individual and the underlying cause of the hair loss.
