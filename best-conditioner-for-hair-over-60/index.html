Use a small amount of conditioner.</h4><p>A little goes a long way when it comes to conditioner. Use a small amount and focus on the ends of your hair, where it tends to be the driest and most damaged.</p><h4>2. Leave the conditioner on for a few minutes.</h4><p>Allow the conditioner to penetrate your hair by leaving it on for a few minutes before rinsing. This will help to maximize its benefits and leave your hair feeling soft and hydrated.</p><h4>3. Rinse with cool water.</h4><p>After conditioning, rinse your hair with cool water to help seal the cuticles and lock in moisture. This will also help to add shine to your hair.</p><h4>4. Use a wide-tooth comb.</h4><p>Gently detangle your hair with a wide-tooth comb after conditioning to prevent breakage. Start from the ends and work your way up to the roots.</p><h2>Conclusion of the Best Conditioner for Hair over 60</h2><p>Finding the best conditioner for hair over 60 can make a world of difference in the health and appearance of your hair. Look for a conditioner that is hydrating, nourishing, and specifically formulated to address the unique needs of aging hair.
