In this article, we will explore the hairstyles that suit an oblong face shape and help you rock any look with confidence.</p><p>Having an oblong face shape can present its own set of challenges when it comes to choosing the right hairstyle. One of the main pain points is finding a style that doesn't elongate the face further. Many people with an oblong face shape often struggle with finding a style that adds width and balances out the length of the face.</p><p>If you have an oblong face shape, don't worry! There are plenty of hairstyles that can enhance your features and flatter your face shape. The key is to choose styles that add volume to the sides of your face, creating the illusion of width. Additionally, hairstyles with soft layers or curls can help soften the angles of your face and add dimension.</p><p>In summary, when it comes to hairstyles for an oblong face shape, the key is to add width and balance out the length of the face. Styles with volume, soft layers, and curls can help achieve this. Now, let's dive deeper into the different aspects of hairstyles for an oblong face shape.</p><h2>What Hairstyles Suit an Oblong Face Shape?</h2><p>When it comes to choosing a hairstyle for an oblong face shape, there are a few factors to consider. The length, texture, and volume of the hair can all play a role in finding the perfect style. Here are some recommendations:</p><h3>Short Hairstyles:</h3><p>Short hairstyles can work well for oblong face shapes as they add width and balance to the face. Pixie cuts, layered bobs, or short shaggy hairstyles can all be flattering options. Adding texture or curls to short hair can also help create the illusion of width.</p><h3>Medium Length Hairstyles:</h3><p>Medium length hairstyles that add volume and width to the sides of the face can be a great choice for oblong face shapes. Consider shoulder-length cuts, layered styles, or beachy waves to add softness and balance.</p><h3>Long Hairstyles:</h3><p>For those with long hair, adding layers, waves, or curls can help break up the length of the face and add volume to the sides. Avoid straight, sleek styles that can accentuate the length of the face.</p><h3>Bangs:</h3><p>Bangs can be a game-changer for oblong face shapes. Adding bangs can help shorten the face and create the illusion of width. Consider side-swept bangs, curtain bangs, or wispy bangs to soften the forehead and balance out the face.</p><h3>Updos and Ponytails:</h3><p>When it comes to updos and ponytails, opt for styles that add volume and width to the sides of the face.
