So, grab your comb and let's get started!</p><p>The 70's was a decade known for its bold and experimental fashion and hairstyles. People were looking for ways to express themselves and break away from traditional norms. This led to the rise of unique and unconventional hairstyles that became synonymous with the era.</p><p>So, what were the popular hairstyles in the 70's? Let's find out!</p><p>In the 70's, one of the most iconic hairstyles was the Afro. This voluminous and natural hairstyle became a symbol of black pride and empowerment.
