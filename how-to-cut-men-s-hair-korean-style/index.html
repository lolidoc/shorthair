First and foremost, it's important to have a clear understanding of the desired style. This will help guide you throughout the haircutting process. Additionally, you'll need to gather all the necessary tools, including a pair of sharp scissors, a comb, and hair clippers.</p><p>Once you have everything you need, you can begin the haircutting process. Start by wetting the hair and combing it through to remove any tangles. Next, use the hair clippers to trim the sides and back of the head, leaving the top longer.

It's important to take your time and make small, precise cuts to achieve the desired look.</p><p>Once the hair is cut to the desired length, use the scissors to add texture and shape to the hair.
