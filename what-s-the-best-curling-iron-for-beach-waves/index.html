Prep your hair: Before using a curling iron, make sure your hair is clean and dry. Apply a heat protectant spray to protect your hair from heat damage.</p><p>2. Section your hair: Divide your hair into sections to make it easier to curl. Start at the bottom and work your way up.</p><p>3. Wrap your hair around the barrel: Take a small section of hair and wrap it around the barrel, starting at the roots and working your way down. Hold for a few seconds and then release.</p><p>4.
