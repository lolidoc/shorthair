However, with the right haircut and styling techniques, you can enhance your features and achieve a flattering look. Short layered hairstyles are a great option for those with thick hair and round faces. They add dimension, movement, and can help to frame your face beautifully. In this article, we will explore some of the best short layered hairstyles for thick hair and round faces in 2023.</p><h2>1. Pixie Cut</h2><p>A pixie cut is a timeless and versatile hairstyle that works well for round faces and thick hair. The short layers in a pixie cut add volume and texture, making it a perfect choice for those with thick locks. This hairstyle also helps to elongate the face, creating a more balanced look. You can opt for a sleek pixie cut or add some texture and tousle for a more edgy vibe.</p><h2>2. Bob with Side Swept Bangs</h2><p>A bob haircut with side-swept bangs is another excellent option for round faces and thick hair. The layers in the bob add movement, while the side-swept bangs help to create an illusion of length. This hairstyle also draws attention to the eyes, making it a flattering choice for those with round faces. You can style the bob straight, wavy, or add some curls for a romantic touch.</p><h2>3. Shaggy Layers</h2><p>If you're looking for a low-maintenance yet stylish haircut, shaggy layers are the way to go. This hairstyle works well for both round faces and thick hair, as it adds texture and volume without requiring too much styling. The shaggy layers help to create a more angular appearance, balancing out the roundness of the face. You can leave the layers tousled for a relaxed look or style them with a flat iron for a sleeker finish.</p><h2>4. Textured Pixie with Bangs</h2><p>A textured pixie cut with bangs is a modern and chic hairstyle that suits round faces and thick hair perfectly. The textured layers add movement and dimension, while the bangs help to frame the face. This hairstyle also works well for those with thick hair, as it allows for easy styling and maintenance. You can add some texturizing spray or pomade to enhance the layers and create a more edgy look.</p><h2>5. Layered Bob with Highlights</h2><p>A layered bob with highlights is a beautiful choice for round faces and thick hair. The layers in the bob help to create a more elongated appearance, while the highlights add depth and dimension. This hairstyle also works well for those with thick hair, as the layers help to reduce bulk and make styling easier. You can opt for subtle highlights for a natural look or go for bolder colors to add a touch of personality.</p><h2>6. Asymmetrical Bob</h2><p>An asymmetrical bob is a trendy and stylish haircut that can flatter round faces and thick hair. The asymmetrical cut adds an element of interest and helps to create a more angular appearance. This hairstyle also works well for those with thick hair, as the layers help to reduce volume. You can style the bob straight, curly, or add some waves for a more textured look.</p><h2>7. Textured Crop</h2><p>A textured crop is a short and sassy haircut that suits round faces and thick hair perfectly. The textured layers add movement and volume, while the shorter length helps to create a more balanced look. This hairstyle works well for those with thick hair, as it allows for easy styling and maintenance. You can add some texturizing spray or styling product to enhance the layers and create a more effortless look.</p><h2>8. Layered Pixie with Side Swept Bangs</h2><p>A layered pixie cut with side-swept bangs is a chic and stylish option for round faces and thick hair. The layers in the pixie cut add texture and dimension, while the side-swept bangs help to create an elongated appearance. This hairstyle also works well for those with thick hair, as it allows for easy styling and maintenance. You can style the pixie sleek and straight or add some waves for a more playful look.</p><h2>9. Messy Bob</h2><p>A messy bob is a trendy and effortless hairstyle that works well for round faces and thick hair. The choppy layers add texture and movement, while the messy styling creates a more relaxed and carefree look. This hairstyle also helps to create a more angular appearance, balancing out the roundness of the face. You can tousle the layers with your fingers or use a texturizing spray to enhance the messy vibe.</p><h2>10. Layered Lob</h2><p>A layered lob, or long bob, is a versatile and flattering hairstyle for round faces and thick hair. The layers in the lob add movement and dimension, while the longer length helps to create a more balanced look. This hairstyle also works well for those with thick hair, as the layers help to reduce bulk. You can style the lob straight, wavy, or add some curls for a more glamorous touch.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>When it comes to short layered hairstyles for thick hair and round faces, there are plenty of options to choose from. Whether you prefer a pixie cut, bob, or something in between, the key is to find a hairstyle that adds dimension, movement, and flatters your features. Experiment with different cuts, lengths, and styling techniques to discover the perfect short layered hairstyle that enhances your natural beauty.</p></article>
