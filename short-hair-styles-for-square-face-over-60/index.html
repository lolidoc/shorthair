This can make it challenging to find a hairstyle that complements our features. The square face shape is characterized by a strong jawline and wide forehead, so it's important to choose a style that softens these areas and brings attention to the eyes and cheekbones.</p><p>Short hair styles for square faces over 60 should aim to create balance and enhance your natural beauty. They should also be low-maintenance and easy to style, as we often have less time and energy to spend on our hair as we age.</p><h2>Short Hair Styles for Square Face Over 60</h2><p>One of the most flattering short hair styles for square faces over 60 is the pixie cut. This timeless and versatile style can be customized to suit your unique features. The short layers and side-swept bangs soften the jawline and draw attention to the eyes.</p><p>Another great option is the bob haircut. This classic style can be worn in various lengths and with or without bangs. A chin-length bob with soft layers and a side part is particularly flattering for square faces over 60. It adds movement and frames the face beautifully.</p><p>If you prefer a longer style, consider a shoulder-length cut with layers.

Remember, it's never too late to try something new and embrace your unique features!</p><h2>The Myth of Short Hair Styles for Square Face Over 60</h2><p>There is a common misconception that older women should only wear long hair.
