Take into account your personal style: The quiz takes into account your personal style preferences when providing recommendations. Consider whether you prefer a classic or edgy look, and choose hairstyles that align with your individual style.</p><p>3. Look for inspiration: Before taking the quiz, look for inspiration in magazines, online, or on social media. Collect images of hairstyles that you like and that you think would suit your face shape.
