Finally, the curly shag is another popular choice for thick curly hair. This haircut features layers throughout the hair and creates a textured, lived-in look. It's a great option for those who want a low-maintenance style that still looks fashionable.</p><h3>Personal Experience with finding the best haircut for thick curly hair</h3><p>As someone with thick curly hair, I understand the struggle of finding the perfect haircut. For years, I struggled with frizz, tangles, and a lack of definition in my curls. It wasn't until I found a stylist who specialized in curly hair that I was able to find a haircut that truly worked for me. She recommended a layered haircut that removed some of the bulk from my hair and enhanced my natural curl pattern. Since getting this haircut, I've noticed a significant improvement in the manageability and overall appearance of my hair.
