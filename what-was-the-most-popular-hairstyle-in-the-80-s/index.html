People were not afraid to experiment with their hair and express their individuality. From the iconic mullet to the voluminous perms, the 80's hairstyles left a lasting impact on the world of fashion. In this article, we will explore the most popular hairstyle of that era.</p><h3>The Mullet: Business in the Front, Party in the Back</h3><p>One of the most iconic hairstyles of the 80's was the mullet. This hairstyle featured short hair at the front and sides, while the back was left long and flowing. It was often associated with the rebellious and carefree attitude of the decade. Celebrities like Billy Ray Cyrus and David Bowie popularized this trend, making it a symbol of rock and roll.</p><h3>Big Hair and Perms: The Bigger, the Better</h3><p>Another trend that dominated the 80's was big hair. Women embraced volume and curls, often achieving it through perms. The perm involved chemically treating the hair to create tight curls or waves. This style was popularized by celebrities like Whitney Houston and Madonna, who made big hair synonymous with glamour and confidence.</p><h3>Afros: Celebrating Natural Hair</h3><p>In the 80's, there was a resurgence of embracing natural hair, and the afro became a symbol of African-American pride. This bold and voluminous hairstyle was a statement of cultural identity and empowerment. Celebrities like Michael Jackson and Diana Ross proudly rocked their afros, inspiring others to embrace their natural hair texture.</p><h3>Crimped Hair: Adding Texture and Edge</h3><p>Crimped hair was another popular trend in the 80's. This style involved using a crimping iron to create small, zigzag-like waves throughout the hair. It added texture and edge to any look. Many pop stars, such as Cyndi Lauper and Debbie Gibson, embraced this trend, making it a staple of the 80's fashion scene.</p><h3>Spiky Hair: Punk and Rebellion</h3><p>Punk culture heavily influenced the hairstyles of the 80's. Spiky hair became a symbol of rebellion and non-conformity. This style involved using copious amounts of hair gel or hairspray to create sharp spikes that stood upright. Bands like The Clash and The Sex Pistols popularized this edgy look, inspiring a generation of punk enthusiasts.</p><h3>Bouffant and Teased Hair: Glamour and Elegance</h3><p>For those who wanted a more glamorous and elegant look, the bouffant and teased hair were the go-to styles. The bouffant involved creating a rounded shape at the crown by teasing the hair and adding volume. This style was often seen on celebrities attending red carpet events. It exuded sophistication and class.</p><h3>Banana Clip: Functional and Stylish</h3><p>The banana clip was a popular hair accessory in the 80's. It was not only functional but also added a stylish touch to any hairstyle. This clip allowed people to gather their hair into a ponytail or updo easily. It was versatile and came in various colors and designs, making it a must-have accessory for many.</p><h3>Rat Tails: A Unique and Controversial Trend</h3><p>Although not as popular or widely accepted as other hairstyles, the rat tail was a unique trend in the 80's. This style involved leaving a long, thin section of hair at the back of the head, resembling a rat's tail. It was often associated with the skateboarding and surfer subcultures. While some embraced this trend, others found it controversial.</p><h3>Bangs: Framing the Face</h3><p>Bangs were a versatile hairstyle choice in the 80's. They could be worn straight across the forehead or swept to the side. Bangs added a youthful and playful touch to any look. Many celebrities, such as Molly Ringwald and Brooke Shields, rocked this style, making it a popular choice among young women.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>The 80's was a decade of bold and experimental hairstyles. From the mullet to big hair, afros to spiky hairstyles, there was no shortage of unique trends. Whether you preferred a rebellious look or a glamorous style, the 80's had something for everyone. These hairstyles continue to inspire and influence contemporary fashion, proving that the 80's left an indelible mark on the world of hairstyling.</p></article>
