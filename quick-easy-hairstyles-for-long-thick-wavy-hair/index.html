This hairstyle is perfect for those days when you don't have a lot of time to spend on your hair, but still want to look put together. To create a messy bun, start by gathering your hair into a high ponytail at the crown of your head. Secure it with an elastic band, but leave some pieces out to frame your face. Twist the ponytail around the base and secure it with bobby pins. Pull out a few pieces to create a messy, undone look. Finish with a spritz of hairspray to hold everything in place. </p><h2>Quick Easy Hairstyles for Long Thick Wavy Hair: The Beachy Waves</h2><p> If you're looking for a more relaxed and tousled look, beachy waves are the way to go. This hairstyle is perfect for those with long, thick, wavy hair, as it enhances the natural texture and adds volume and movement. To create beachy waves, start by applying a texturizing spray or sea salt spray to damp hair. Scrunch your hair with your hands to enhance the waves and let it air dry or use a diffuser on low heat. Once your hair is dry, use a curling wand to add definition to any pieces that need it. Finish with a spritz of hairspray to hold the waves in place. </p><h2>Quick Easy Hairstyles for Long Thick Wavy Hair: The Half-Up Half-Down</h2><p> Another quick and easy hairstyle for long, thick, wavy hair is the half-up half-down look. This hairstyle is perfect for those who want to keep their hair out of their face but still show off their beautiful waves. To create a half-up half-down hairstyle, start by gathering the top half of your hair and securing it with a small elastic band. You can leave some pieces out to frame your face or add a cute hair accessory for a touch of flair. For added volume and texture, you can also tease the crown of your hair before securing it. Finish with a spritz of hairspray to hold everything in place. </p><h3>Quick Easy Hairstyles for Long Thick Wavy Hair: The Low Ponytail</h3><p> For a sleek and polished look, the low ponytail is a quick and easy hairstyle that never goes out of style. To create a low ponytail, start by brushing your hair back and gathering it at the nape of your neck. Secure it with an elastic band, making sure it's tight enough to hold your hair in place. For a more polished look, you can wrap a small section of hair around the elastic band to hide it. Finish with a spritz of hairspray to keep any flyaways in place. </p><h2>Quick Easy Hairstyles for Long Thick Wavy Hair: Conclusion</h2><p> In conclusion, there are plenty of quick and easy hairstyles for long, thick, wavy hair that can help you achieve a stylish and put-together look in no time.

Look for lightweight mousses, texturizing sprays, and sea salt sprays that add volume and hold without leaving your hair feeling sticky or crunchy. </p><h4>Q: How can I keep my long, thick, wavy hair from getting frizzy?</h4><p> A: Frizz is a common problem for those with long, thick, wavy hair. To prevent frizz, make sure to use a hydrating shampoo and conditioner to keep your hair moisturized. Avoid brushing your hair when it's dry, as this can cause frizz. Instead, use a wide-tooth comb or your fingers to detangle your hair when it's wet. You can also use a leave-in conditioner or anti-frizz serum to smooth out any flyaways and add shine. </p><h4>Q: How often should I wash my long, thick, wavy hair?</h4><p> A: The frequency of washing your long, thick, wavy hair depends on your personal preference and your hair's needs. Some people find that washing their hair every other day or every few days works best for them, while others prefer to wash their hair daily. Experiment with different washing schedules to find what works best for you. It's also important to use a shampoo and conditioner that are suitable for your hair type. </p><h4>Q: Can I still straighten my long, thick, wavy hair if I want a different look?</h4><p> A: Absolutely! One of the great things about long, thick, wavy hair is that it can be easily straightened if you want a different look. To straighten your hair, start by applying a heat protectant spray to prevent damage. Then, use a flat iron to straighten small sections of your hair, starting from the roots and working your way down to the ends. Finish with a spritz of hairspray to hold the style in place. </p><h2>Conclusion of Quick Easy Hairstyles for Long Thick Wavy Hair</h2><p> In conclusion, having long, thick, wavy hair doesn't have to be a challenge when it comes to styling.
