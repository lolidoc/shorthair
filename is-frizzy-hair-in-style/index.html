Embracing your natural texture and volume can give your hair a unique and stylish look that sets you apart from the crowd.</p><h2>What is Frizzy Hair?</h2><p>Frizzy hair is characterized by its tendency to be dry, coarse, and prone to frizz. It often lacks moisture and can be difficult to manage and style. Frizzy hair can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetics, humidity, and damage from heat styling or chemical treatments.</p><p>Frizzy hair is different from other hair types because it lacks the natural oils that help keep hair smooth and shiny.
