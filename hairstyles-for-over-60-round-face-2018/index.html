Do you struggle to find hairstyles that flatter your face shape and make you feel confident and beautiful? Well, look no further! In this blog post, we will explore the best hairstyles for over 60 round faces in 2018. Whether you prefer short, medium, or long hair, we've got you covered!</p><p>As we age, our faces naturally change shape, and it can be challenging to find hairstyles that complement our features. Round faces tend to have full cheeks and a rounded chin, so it's essential to choose a hairstyle that adds length and angles to the face. It's also crucial to select a style that suits your personality and lifestyle.</p><p>If you're looking for hairstyles for over 60 round faces in 2018, you're in luck! There are plenty of options to choose from that will enhance your natural beauty and make you look and feel fabulous.</p><p>Here are some key points to consider when choosing a hairstyle for a round face:</p><h2>1. Length:</h2><p>The length of your hair can make a significant difference in how it flatters your face shape. Generally, longer hairstyles with layers and angles help elongate the face and create the illusion of a more oval shape. Shorter hairstyles can also work well, as long as they have volume and texture on the top to balance out the roundness of the face.</p><h2>2. Bangs:</h2><p>Bangs can be a great way to add some angles and dimension to a round face. Side-swept bangs or long, wispy bangs that graze the eyebrows can help create the illusion of a longer face. Avoid blunt, straight-across bangs, as they can make the face appear rounder.</p><h2>3. Layers:</h2><p>Layers are your best friend when it comes to hairstyles for round faces. They add texture, movement, and dimension, which can help create angles and break up the roundness of the face. Opt for layers that start around the cheekbones or jawline to add definition to your face.</p><h2>4. Volume:</h2><p>Adding volume to the crown of your head can help elongate a round face. Consider hairstyles with height and lift at the roots, such as a voluminous pixie cut or a layered bob. Avoid hairstyles that are too flat and sleek, as they can make the face appear wider.</p><h2>5. Texture:</h2><p>Hairstyles with texture, such as curls or waves, can add interest and soften the roundness of the face. Embrace your natural texture or use hot tools to create loose curls or beachy waves. Avoid hairstyles that are too sleek and straight, as they can accentuate the roundness of the face.</p><h3>Conclusion:</h3><p>Choosing the right hairstyle for your round face can make a world of difference in how you look and feel. By considering factors such as length, bangs, layers, volume, and texture, you can find a hairstyle that flatters your face shape and enhances your natural beauty. Don't be afraid to experiment with different styles and consult with a hairstylist who specializes in hairstyles for over 60 round faces. With the right hairstyle, you can feel confident, beautiful, and ageless!</p><h2>Hairstyles for Over 60 Round Face 2018 - A Personal Experience</h2><p>As a woman over 60 with a round face, I understand the challenges of finding the perfect hairstyle. For years, I struggled to find a style that made me feel confident and beautiful. I tried various lengths and cuts, but nothing seemed to work.</p><p>Then, I discovered the power of layers. I visited a hairstylist who specialized in hairstyles for round faces, and she recommended a layered bob with side-swept bangs. I was hesitant at first, but I decided to give it a try.</p><p>The moment she finished styling my hair, I couldn't believe my eyes. The layers added volume and movement, while the side-swept bangs framed my face and created angles. I instantly felt more confident and beautiful.</p><p>Since then, I've experimented with different lengths and styles, but I always come back to the layered bob. It's versatile, easy to maintain, and most importantly, it flatters my round face. I've received countless compliments on my hair, and I finally feel like I've found the perfect hairstyle for me.</p><p>If you're a woman over 60 with a round face, I encourage you to embrace your unique features and find a hairstyle that makes you feel confident and beautiful.
