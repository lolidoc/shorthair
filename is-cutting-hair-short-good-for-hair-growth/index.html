You're not alone. Many people believe that cutting their hair short will stimulate hair growth, while others are skeptical. In this blog post, we will explore the topic of whether cutting hair short is good for hair growth and provide you with all the information you need to make an informed decision.</p><p>When it comes to hair growth, there are several pain points that people commonly experience. These include slow hair growth, hair thinning, and hair breakage. It's important to address these issues and find solutions that work for you.
