Look no further! In this blog post, we will discuss how to wear long thick hair up in various styles that are both practical and stylish.</p><p>Having long, thick hair can be a blessing and a curse. While it can look beautiful when worn down, it can also be heavy and difficult to manage. Additionally, wearing your hair up can help keep it out of your face and off your neck, especially during hot summer months.</p><p>One popular way to wear long thick hair up is in a high ponytail. This style is simple and classic, and it works well for both casual and formal occasions. To achieve this look, gather your hair at the crown of your head and secure it with an elastic band. For added volume, tease the hair at the crown before securing it.</p><p>If you prefer a more polished look, consider trying a sleek bun. This style is perfect for formal events or professional settings. To create a sleek bun, gather your hair into a high ponytail and twist it around the base. Secure the bun with bobby pins, and use hairspray to keep it in place.</p><p>For a romantic and bohemian look, try a messy updo. This style is perfect for weddings or other special occasions. To achieve a messy updo, start by curling your hair with a curling iron or wand. Then, loosely gather your hair at the nape of your neck and secure it with bobby pins. Pull out a few strands of hair to frame your face, and finish with hairspray.</p><h2>Personal Experience with Wearing Long Thick Hair Up</h2><p>As someone with long, thick hair, I have struggled to find hairstyles that work well for me. However, after experimenting with different updos, I have found a few styles that I love. One of my go-to looks is a low messy bun. I find that this style is both effortless and chic, and it works well for both casual and formal occasions. To create a low messy bun, I start by gathering my hair into a low ponytail and twisting it around the base. I then secure the bun with bobby pins, and pull out a few strands of hair to frame my face. I finish the look with a spritz of hairspray to keep everything in place.</p><h2>What is Wearing Long Thick Hair Up?</h2><p>Wearing long thick hair up refers to styling your hair in an updo or an up-style, rather than wearing it down. This can be done in various ways, such as a ponytail, bun, or updo. Wearing your hair up can help keep it out of your face and off your neck, making it a practical choice for hot summer months or formal occasions.</p><h2>History and Myth of Wearing Long Thick Hair Up</h2><p>The practice of wearing long thick hair up has been around for centuries. In ancient civilizations, such as Egypt and Greece, women would often wear their hair up as a sign of beauty and elegance. In some cultures, long hair was considered a symbol of femininity and was only worn down on special occasions.</p><p>There are also several myths and superstitions surrounding wearing long thick hair up. For example, some believe that wearing your hair up can help protect it from damage and breakage. Others believe that wearing your hair up can help promote hair growth.</p><h2>The Hidden Secret of Wearing Long Thick Hair Up</h2><p>The hidden secret of wearing long thick hair up is that it can actually help to protect your hair and promote its overall health. By keeping your hair pulled back and off your face and neck, you can prevent damage from heat styling tools, environmental factors, and friction. Additionally, wearing your hair up can help distribute the natural oils from your scalp to the ends of your hair, keeping it moisturized and reducing the risk of dryness and breakage.</p><h2>Recommendation for Wearing Long Thick Hair Up</h2><p>If you're looking to wear your long thick hair up, here are a few recommendations to keep in mind:</p><ol><li>Choose a style that works well with your hair texture and length. Some styles may work better for fine hair, while others may be more suited for thick hair.</li><li>Invest in high-quality hair accessories, such as elastic bands, bobby pins, and hair spray, to help keep your updo in place.</li><li>Experiment with different styles and techniques to find what works best for you. Don't be afraid to try new things and step out of your comfort zone.</li><li>Consult with a hairstylist for personalized recommendations and tips on how to wear your long thick hair up.</li></ol><h3>How to Wear Long Thick Hair Up and Related Keywords</h3><p>When it comes to wearing long thick hair up, there are a few key points to keep in mind.
