Short hair was also associated with power and status, with many rulers and pharaohs opting for cropped styles.</p><p>In more recent history, short hair became popular in the 1920s with the rise of the flapper movement. Women began to embrace shorter, more androgynous styles as a way to rebel against societal norms. This trend continued to evolve throughout the 20th century, with iconic hairstyles like the pixie cut and the bob becoming staples in the fashion world.</p><p>While there are no specific myths associated with short hairstyles, they have long been associated with strength and confidence.
