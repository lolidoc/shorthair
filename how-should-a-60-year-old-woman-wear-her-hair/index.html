The answer really depends on personal preference and individual features. However, there are a few general guidelines that can help women in their 60s choose a flattering hairstyle. First, it's important to consider the shape of your face. Certain styles, like bob cuts or pixie cuts, can accentuate features and create a more youthful appearance. Second, it's important to choose a style that suits your lifestyle. If you're an active person who enjoys outdoor activities, a low-maintenance style may be the best choice.
