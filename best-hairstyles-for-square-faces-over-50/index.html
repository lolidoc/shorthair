Square faces, characterized by a strong jawline and angular features, can benefit from hairstyles that soften and balance the face.</p><p>If you have a square face shape and are over 50, you may be looking for hairstyles that flatter your features and make you look youthful and vibrant. The key is to choose a hairstyle that adds softness and femininity to your face while complementing your natural beauty.</p><p>In this article, we'll discuss the best hairstyles for square faces over 50 and provide recommendations that will help you achieve the look you desire.

After trying various styles, I have discovered a few that work well for me and make me feel confident and beautiful.</p><p>One of my favorite hairstyles for my square face shape is a layered bob. The layers add movement and softness to my face, while the bob length accentuates my jawline. I also love to add side-swept bangs to frame my face and create a more balanced look.</p><p>Another hairstyle that works well for square faces over 50 is a shoulder-length shag. The layers and texture of the shag add volume and dimension to the hair, softening the angular features of the face. I like to pair this style with a middle part to create a more symmetrical look.</p><h2>What Are Best Hairstyles for Square Faces Over 50?</h2><p>Best hairstyles for square faces over 50 are those that add softness and femininity to the face while complementing the natural beauty of the individual.
