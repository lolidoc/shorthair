This will allow you to get a more accurate cut and prevent any damage to your hair.</p><h3>Step 2: Section Off Your Hair</h3><p>Next, section off your hair into manageable sections and secure them with clips. This will make it easier to trim your hair evenly and prevent any missed spots.</p><h3>Step 3: Trim Small Sections at a Time</h3><p>Using sharp hairdressing scissors, trim small sections of hair at a time.

Start with the longer sections and work your way up to the shorter sections.</p><h3>Step 4: Check for Evenness</h3><p>After trimming each section, check for evenness by combing through your hair and comparing the lengths. If you notice any uneven spots, go back and trim them until you achieve a balanced look.</p><h3>Step 5: Finish with Styling</h3><p>Once you have finished trimming your short permed hair, style it as desired.
