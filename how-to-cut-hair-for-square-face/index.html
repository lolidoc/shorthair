In this blog post, we will discuss how to cut hair for square face and give you some tips and tricks to enhance your natural beauty.</p><p>Having a square face shape can be both a blessing and a curse. While it gives you strong, defined features, it can also make finding the right haircut a bit challenging. You may struggle to find a style that softens your angles and flatters your face shape. But fear not, we're here to help!</p><p>If you have a square face shape, the key is to choose a hairstyle that adds softness and balances out your strong jawline. One of the best ways to achieve this is by opting for layers or bangs. Layers can help to create movement and soften the angles of your face, while bangs can draw attention away from your jawline.</p><p>To cut hair for square face, consider a long layered haircut. This style adds texture and movement to your hair, creating a softer look. You can also try a shoulder-length bob with soft, face-framing layers to add dimension to your hair.
