Look no further! In this post, we will explore the best short haircuts for square faces in 2020. Whether you have a square face shape or know someone who does, this post will provide you with all the information you need to make the right choice.</p><p>When it comes to choosing a haircut for a square face shape, there are a few key factors to consider. Square faces typically have a strong jawline and wide forehead, so it's important to choose a haircut that will soften these features and create balance. Additionally, you'll want to choose a haircut that flatters your unique facial features and enhances your natural beauty.</p><p>The best short haircuts for square faces in 2020 are those that add softness and femininity to the face. These haircuts typically feature layers, waves, or curls that help to soften the angular features of a square face. They also tend to be shorter in length, as longer hairstyles can often make a square face shape appear more boxy.</p><p>In summary, the best short haircuts for square faces in 2020 are those that add softness and femininity to the face. These haircuts typically feature layers, waves, or curls that help to soften the angular features of a square face. They also tend to be shorter in length, as longer hairstyles can often make a square face shape appear more boxy.</p><h2>Best Short Haircuts for Square Faces 2020: Personal Experience</h2><p>As someone with a square face shape, I can personally attest to the power of a great haircut. When I first started experimenting with different hairstyles, I found that shorter cuts that added movement and volume to my hair were the most flattering. These cuts helped to soften the angles of my face and draw attention to my best features.</p><p>One of my favorite short haircuts for square faces is the bob. This timeless haircut can be customized to suit any face shape, but it works particularly well for square faces. The bob adds volume to the crown of the head, which helps to create balance and soften the strong jawline. Adding some subtle layers or waves to the bob can also help to add movement and further enhance the face shape.</p><p>Another great option for square faces is the pixie cut. This short, edgy style can help to highlight your facial features and draw attention upwards. By keeping the sides and back of the hair short, you can create the illusion of a longer, more oval-shaped face. Adding some texture or spikes to the top of the hair can also add interest and dimension.</p><h2>Best Short Haircuts for Square Faces 2020: What is it?</h2><p>The best short haircuts for square faces in 2020 are hairstyles that are specifically designed to flatter and enhance the unique features of a square face shape.
