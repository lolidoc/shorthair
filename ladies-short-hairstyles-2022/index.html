In ancient times, short hair was often associated with strength and power. For example, in ancient Egypt, women would shave their heads and wear wigs as a symbol of beauty and status.</p><p>In more recent history, short hairstyles became popular in the 1920s during the flapper era. Women started cutting their hair short as a symbol of independence and rebellion against traditional gender norms. This trend continued throughout the decades, with iconic figures like Audrey Hepburn and Twiggy sporting chic and timeless short hairstyles.</p><p>Today, short hairstyles continue to be a symbol of confidence and individuality.
