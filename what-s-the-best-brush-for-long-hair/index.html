Are you tired of using brushes that don't seem to work well with your long locks? If so, you're not alone. Many people with long hair struggle to find the best brush that can effectively detangle and style their hair without causing damage or breakage.</p><p>When it comes to long hair, finding the right brush is essential. Long hair is more prone to tangling, and using the wrong brush can lead to breakage and split ends. It's important to choose a brush that is gentle on your hair while still being able to effectively detangle and style it.</p><p>The best brush for long hair is one that has wide-spaced bristles or teeth. This type of brush is able to detangle your hair without pulling or snagging it.

They can assess your hair type and recommend the best brush for your specific needs.

Then, fill a bowl with warm water and a few drops of shampoo. Gently swirl the brush in the soapy water, being careful not to wet the handle.
